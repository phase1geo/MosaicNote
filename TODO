TODO:

 ☐ Add support for table note item
   ☐ Use ColumnView widget with embedded textboxes
 ☐ Add support for math note item
   Still trying to figure out what to do here.
   I would like to use AsciiMath for the text input and generate a PNG file
 ☐ Add support for note linking
   ☐ Add auto-completion when entering note links
   ☐ Add button to copy a note link to the clipboard
   ☐ Add ability to past note link into a note
 ☐ Add support for undo/redo
   Need to figure out what we will be able to undo/redo (it won't be everything)
 ☐ Add UML "templates"
   We will probably just use the UML examples from the PlantUML website here

TODO:

 ☐ Add support for math note item
   Still trying to figure out what to do here.
   I would like to use AsciiMath for the text input and generate a PNG file
 ☐ Add support for file/asset manager note item
   Allows the user to add file links, URLs, etc. and they are saved in an editable list
 ☐ Add support for note linking
   ☐ Add auto-completion when entering note links
     Not exactly sure how to currently implement this
   ☐ Add button to copy a note link to the clipboard
   ☐ Add ability to paste note link into a note
   ☐ Create back-linking
     This is going to be tricky because it will require checking for note links in the
     notes whenever a note is saved and updating those notes.
 ☐ Add support for exporting a note item
   ☐ Add ability to save to file or copy to clipboard
 ☐ Add support for NotesPanel sorting
 ☐ Add drag and drop support for organizing notebooks
 ☐ Add drag and drop support for reorganizing smart notebooks
 ☐ Add support for undo/redo
   Need to figure out what we will be able to undo/redo (it won't be everything)

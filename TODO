TODO:

 ☐ Add support for math note item
   Still trying to figure out what to do here.
   I would like to use AsciiMath for the text input and generate a PNG file
 ☐ Add auto-completion when entering note links
   Not exactly sure how to currently implement this
 ☐ Add support for exporting a note item
   ☐ Add ability to save to file or copy to clipboard
 ☐ Add drag and drop support for organizing notebooks
 ☐ Add drag and drop support for reorganizing smart notebooks
 ☐ Add support for undo/redo
   Need to figure out what we will be able to undo/redo (it won't be everything)
 ☐ Add ability to import a note from Markdown format
   Note should do the file processing
 ☐ Add ability to import a directory full of Markdown notes into notebook(s)
   This could be used to import notes from another tool perhaps
 ☐ Add ability to export all notes into a series of directories
   Similar in structure to how IA writer notes are handled (I forget the format)
 ☐ Add support for saving a note as a template.
   ☐ Add support for create a new note based on a saved template.
   ☐ Add support for editing and deleting a note template


BUGS:

  ☐ We are currently unable to add a sub-notebook
  ☐ If a note needs to be displayed, but its notebook is hidden in the sidebar (because its parent is not expanded), expand its ancestors prior to selecting the notebook.
